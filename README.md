# Real-Time Pose Detection using MediaPipe

A real-time human pose detection system that uses MediaPipe and OpenCV to detect and visualize human body landmarks in live video streams or recorded videos.

## üéØ Project Overview

This project implements a real-time pose detection system that can:
- Detect human body pose landmarks in real-time
- Visualize pose connections and keypoints
- Display results on both original video and blank canvas
- Support both webcam input and video file processing
- Provide smooth and accurate pose tracking

**Applications**: Fitness tracking, sports analysis, motion capture, rehabilitation, gesture recognition, and human-computer interaction.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Real-time Processing**: Live pose detection from webcam feed
- **Dual Visualization**: View pose overlay on original video and isolated pose on blank canvas
- **Customizable Styling**: Configurable colors and thickness for pose visualization
- **Flexible Input**: Switch between webcam and video file input
- **Lightweight**: Efficient processing using MediaPipe's optimized models
- **Cross-platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### Core Components

## üìä Pose Landmarks

MediaPipe Pose detects **33 key body landmarks**:

### Upper Body (11 landmarks)
- Nose, Eyes (left/right), Ears (left/right)
- Mouth (left/right corners)
- Shoulders (left/right)
- Elbows (left/right)
- Wrists (left/right)

### Lower Body (22 landmarks)
- Hips (left/right)
- Knees (left/right)
- Ankles (left/right)
- Heels (left/right)
- Foot indices (left/right)
- And additional detailed foot landmarks

## üìà Performance Metrics
